# Code Smells! When code really smells... (Delphi Expert)

"Code Smells" is a funny add-on for Embarcadero Delphi that **plays a fart every time the compilation fails**. ðŸ˜„

It has been built for [ITDevConX Delphi Conference](http://www.itdevcon.it/) as an example of how you can create a simple but functional expert for the Delphi IDE using the [*Open Tools API*](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Extending_the_IDE_Using_the_Tools_API).

The original idea, the audio files and the fart descriptions has been taken from the [Farticus plugin](https://github.com/madskristensen/Farticus) made for Visual Studio by [Mads Kristensen](https://github.com/madskristensen).

## How to install

* Clone the repository or download the source code
* Open the project file (*CodeSmells.dproj*) in the Delphi IDE
* Right click the project file and select **Build**
* If build is successful, right click again the project file and select **Install**
* Close the project

## How to configure

You can enable/disable and configure the tool from the *Options* dialog available under the **Tools|Code Smells Options...** menu.

## How to use

Continue to work in Delphi... everytime you compile your project, in case of errors you will hear a rather annoying noise.
Have fun!!
